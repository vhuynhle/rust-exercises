> If the state is "WI", then each order is taxed 5.5%.
> Otherwise, there is no tax.
> Write a program to calculate the total price, given the order amount and the state name.

This exercise can be solved with an `if` statement:

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../code/chapter_3/src/bin/tax_calculator.rs:if}}
```
