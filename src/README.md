# Introduction

Programming usually involves problem-solving using basic building blocks.
As such, an effective programmer should be *fluent* with the basics and know how to combine them
to solve more complex problems.

To gain proficiency and to develop problem-solving skills, there's no better way than practicing.
I believe the most effective way for a junior programmer to practice is to work in a real project,
ideally under a mentor who can tell good code from bad code, and who can show how they solve problems.

However, not everyone has such opportunities[^1]. Contributing to open-source projects could be another
way to get experience, but digging through the codes of complex projects without a good introduction
is not for the faint-hearted.

The next best step is to solve increasingly complex challenges from books and tutorials. This
definitely helps with learning the basics, building problem-solving skills *up to a level*,
and gaining confidence as a programmer.

I have been trying to pick up the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ "The Rust Programming Language")
programming language. While it is a joy to work with compared to C++, the language is much younger and
there are few Rust job postings[^2].

So here am I, trying to gain proficiency with Rust by following
the challenges in [Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/ "Exercises for Programmers, by Brian P. Hogan").

[^1] My own experience is that many companies want experienced developers without training them.
Not even already *experienced* programmers, but with a different programming language/technology.

[^2] Consistent with the previous footnote, the few job postings in my region call for *experienced*
programmers (even team-leads) in a relative *new* language.

[^3] Although many people suggests books such as [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/ "Programming Rust by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, Leonora F . S. Tindall") after [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ "The Rust Programming Language by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community"), I find doing
challenges less *boring*.
