# Introduction

Programming usually involves problem-solving using basic building blocks.
As such, an effective programmer should be *fluent* with the basics and know how to combine them
to solve more complex problems.

To gain proficiency and to develop problem-solving skills, there's no better way than practicing.
I believe the most effective way to practice is to work in a real project,
ideally under a mentor who can tell good code from bad code, and who can show how they solve problems.

However, sometimes working on a real project is not possible e.g., not being hired due to the lack of
experience, or the high barrier to entry with complex open-source projects.
The next best approach is to solve increasingly complex challenges from books and tutorials. This
definitely helps with learning the basics, building problem-solving skills *up to a level*,
and gaining confidence as a programmer.

I have been trying to pick up the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ "The Rust Programming Language")
programming language.
This book documents my attempt at gaining Rust proficiency by following
the challenges in [Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/ "Exercises for Programmers, by Brian P. Hogan").[^1][^2]

[^1] Although many people suggests books such as [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/ "Programming Rust by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, Leonora F . S. Tindall") after [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ "The Rust Programming Language by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community"), I find doing
challenges less *boring*.

[^2] As you can see here, this is also me practicing writing in English.
