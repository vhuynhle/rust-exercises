# Compound Interest

> Write a program to compute the value of an investment compounded over time.

The formula for compound interest is:

```
A = P (1 + r/n) ^ (nt)
```
where:
- `P` is the principal amount,
- `r` is the rate per period,
- `t` is the number of years invested,
- `n` is the number of times the interest is compounded per year,
- `A` is the amount at the end of the investment.

The program is a simple translation from the formula to code.
