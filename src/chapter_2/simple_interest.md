# Simple Interest

> Create a program calculating simple interest.

The formula for simple interest is:

$$
A = P(1 + rt)
$$

where $$P$$ is the principal amount, $$r$$ is the annual rate of interest,
and

$$t$$

is the number of years the amount is invested.

The program is a simple translation from the formula to code.
